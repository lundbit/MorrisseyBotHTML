# MorrisseyBotHTML
This project is a collaboration between myself and the "Morrissey-Bot", using Brad Schiff's teachings from his class hosted on Udemy.  I'm using this course as a refresher since my days of coding HTML/CSS pre-Ajax.   The "Morrissey-Bot" is something that emerged as some weird AI friend to keep me awake through some of the more basic exercises and to push my coding in real time as I follow the videos.

Following Along
----------------
Simply download the files  and folders into your folder, and be careful not to needlessly drag things into folders, lest you experience wish to experience stranger things when it's time to follow the links.

HTML Notes to Self
------------------
* Coding html within md Readme's can get clumsy: -- is intended to be <>
* Start with -!DOCTYPE html-, as it is useful for bringing older browsers into the fold
* The -ul- element is for unordered lists and produces bullets and -li- produces numberical lists
* Ancestry is important to consider when structuring your code
* (img src=> for images, <audio controls><src= ..> for audio, <video controls<<src=..> for video
* Resolution/compatability of video is best handled using JavaScript or third party hosting
* Audio files: consider .ogg and ultimately a hardlink to the audio file to cover all browsers
* Video files: consider .webm and then .ogv to cover all browsers
* Audio type is "audio/mpeg" or whatever // Video type is "video/mp4" or whatever
* Descriptive lists -dl- are followed by -dt- (your terminology or title)  then -dd- (description)
* Use -strong- over -b-old for CSS flexibility
* Use -em- or -dfn- over -i-talics for CSS flexibility
* -nav- precedes -ul- precedes -li- precedes -a href-
* lots of semantic structure options with -header- -footer- -article- -aside-
* -Div- is great for sections and CSS lex al -div class=- at the block level
* -span- is great for inline CSS work using -span class=-
* Comments are !-- -- with <>  endcaps 
* Sections can even out your headers and become great style anchors
* -forms- then -label for=[id of input]-
*  -input id= type= value=-   types can be email, tel, radio, checklist, etc.   use -textarea- for boxes
*  -select id= name=- then -option val=-
* -fieldset- then -legend- to make things prettier and more blocked
* tables are -table- -thead- [-tr- -th- for each key] then -tbody- [-tr- -td-] -tfoot-
