# MorrisseyBotHTML
This project is a collaboration between myself and the "Morrissey-Bot", using Brad Schiff's teachings from his class hosted on Udemy.  I'm using this course as a refresher since my days of coding HTML/CSS pre-Ajax.   The "Morrissey-Bot" is something that emerged as some weird AI friend to keep me awake through some of the more basic exercises and to push my coding in real time as I follow the videos.

Notes to Self
-------------
* Coding html within md Readme's can get clumsy: -- is intended to be <>
* Start with -!DOCTYPE html-, as it is useful for bringing older browsers into the fold
* The -ul- element is for unordered lists and produces bullets and -li- produces numberical lists
* Ancestry is important to consider when structuring your code
* (img src=> for images, <audio controls><src= ..> for audio, <video controls<<src=..> for video
* Resolution/compatability of video is best handled using JavaScript or third party hosting
* Audio files: consider .ogg and ultimately a hardlink to the audio file to cover all browsers
* Video files: consider .webm and then .ogv to cover all browsers
* Audio type is "audio/mpeg" or whatever // Video type is "video/mp4" or whatever
* Descriptive lists -dl- are followed by -dt- (your terminology or title)  then -dd- (description)
* Use -strong- over -b-old for CSS flexibility
* Use -em- or -dfn- over -i-talics for CSS flexibility
